**HWiNFO** is a powerful utility that allows you to get detailed information about the hardware components of your personal computer (for example, hard disk temperature and S. M. A. R. T. data, sensor readings, etc.). There are indicators in the system tray, real-time monitoring, notifications, report generation and import, and other useful tools and functions.

# Advantages of using HWiNFO

- Does not require Installation, works from the media;
- Intuitive interface with hints;
- Generates reports and runs Performance tests;
- Available settings;
- Informative assessments and conclusions.

# HWiNFO - main features

The application is launched in one of three available modes: in normal mode and display modes of installed components or display values of all sensors available in the system, including operating frequencies, power supply voltage, temperature readings of processors, hard drives, video card, motherboard, memory modules, shows the speed of cooling fans and much more.

All parameters can be set by the user independently in the program settings, and you can immediately save the report in tabular form in the format .CSV. For all parameters read from sensors, there are four values: Current, Minimum, Maximum and Average.
